# Pancakes

* 195 g flour (97.5 g)
* 2 Tbsp sugar (1 Tbsp)
* 1 Tbsp baking powder (1/2 tsp)
* 3/4 tsp kosher salt (1/4 tsp)
* 295 ml milk (147.5 ml)
* 1 large egg (1)
* 4 Tbsp butter (2 Tbsp butter)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract (1 tsp)

Mix dry ingredients thoroughly. Melt butter. Add egg, milk, and butter to dry
ingredients just before cooking. Serves 4 or (2).

Optionally can add fruit. Some prefer to add fruit to the batter, mix, and then
pour into skillet. I prefer adding fruit to the poured batter in the skillet.
This lets me have better control over the ratio of fruit to batter. All fruit
needs to be "pushed" into the batter in the skillet, to help the fruit "stay" in
the middle of the pancake.
