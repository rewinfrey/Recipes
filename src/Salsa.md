# Salsa Roho

* 1 can whole peeled tomatoes
* 1 small onion (experiment with white, yellow, or red for different flavors)
* 2 whole jalepenos
* 1/4 cup fresh cilantro
* 1 or 2 sprigs fresh oregano
* 1 or 2 cloves of garlic
* 2 tsp sea salt
* 1/4 tsp ground cumin
* Juice of 1/2 lime








In a blender, combine all ingredients. Blend until desired texture. For best taste, chill overnight. Is good for 1 week (possibly 2 depending on salt content).
