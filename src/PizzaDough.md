# Pizza Dough

### Napoletana Style

* 5 cups all-purpose flour (22.5 ounces)
* 1 3/4 tsp table salt or 3 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp instant yeast
* 1 3/4 cups plus 2 Tbsp cool water (65 F)

Mix dry ingredients thoroughly. Add water and mix on low for 4 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes. Mix on medium-low speed for 2 minutes, or until dough balls up and clears the side of the mixing bowl.

Transfer dough to floured counter. Dust dough with flour. Fold dough into a ball. Place ball inside oiled container. Cover container to prevent air flow from drying out the top of the dough. Let dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Chill in refrigerator for 24 hours, or if baking dough the same day, refrigerate dough until 2 hours before ready to cook.

Remove dough 2 hours from refrigerator prior to baking. Prepare a lightly oiled non-stick surface for the dough. Transfer dough to the oiled surface and cut into 6 equal pieces. Gently handle the dough to prevent degasing. Cover dough with tea towel or food safe plastic bag and let sit at room temperature for ~2 hours.
