# Pizza Dough

### Napoletana Style

* 5 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 3/4 tsp table salt or 3 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp instant yeast
* 1 3/4 cups plus 2 Tbsp cool water (65 F)

Mix dry ingredients thoroughly. Add water and mix on low for 4 minutes. Let rest
for 5 minutes. Mix on medium-low speed for 2 minutes, or until dough balls up
  and clears the side of the mixing bowl.

Transfer dough to floured counter. Dust dough with flour. Fold dough into
a ball. Place ball inside oiled container. Cover container. Let dough rest at
room temperature for 30 minutes. Refrigerate until 2 hours before ready to cook.

When taking out of refrigerator, lightly oil a non-stick surface and cut the
dough into 6 equal pieces. Gently handle the dough to prevent degasing. Once
dough is transferred, cover and let sit at room temperature for 2 hours.
